## Merlins-Labs

The Merlins-labs hosts a series of repositories relating to the Merlins blockchain and tooling for cosmos.

The Merlins blockchain is a decentralized network, ran by 100+ validators and full nodes, with many front-ends and development teams on it.

Docs for the network can be found at docs.jinx.army. Some repositories of interest:

## State machine

* [Merlins](https://github.com/Merlins-labs/Merlins) - A node implementation for the Merlins chain
* [cosmos-sdk fork](https://github.com/Merlins-labs/cosmos-sdk) - Fork of the cosmos SDK used in Merlins

Go to https://get.jinx.army to quickstart setting up a node!

## Cosmwasm ecosystem

* [beaker](https://github.com/Merlins-labs/beaker) - Dev tooling for cosmwasm contracts
* [Merlins-rust](https://github.com/Merlins-labs/Merlins-rust) - Library of Stargate messages, queries and bindings for Merlins, along with sample contracts.

(TODO: Link to sample contracts here)

## JS tooling

* [telescope](https://github.com/Merlins-labs/telescope) - protobuf transpilation tooling, to easily setup TS clients to interact with chains
* [Merlins-frontend](https://github.com/Merlins-labs/Merlins-frontend) - Sample front-end implementation for the Merlins blockchain. There are many front-ends in the ecosystem.
